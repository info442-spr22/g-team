## Mission Statement

Inspiring and cultivating mental well being amongst women in tech

## Problem Statement

In addition to the gender disparity in tech, the pandemic has detrimentally contributed to the mental health of women in tech.

As documented in the Sustainable Development Goals report, "suicide is among the leading causes of mortality among people aged 15 to 29..." (SDG, 2021). Over the course of the pandemic, young adults with existing mental health have been adversely impacted by the lockdown guidelines. In addition, the pandemic has been adding onto the burdens of unpaid work for women much more than men (UN, 2021) and women in tech are twice as likely to get laid off compared to men (Daley, 2021). Research surrounding women working in STEM fields shows they are likely to report “higher levels of stress and anxiety and higher incidences of depression” (Lynch, 2016). These factors have been shown to be a determining component for work engagement and intention-to-leave one’s job (Reiley et. al., 2018). The gender disparity in tech sources from many different factors and one main factor that creates a larger gap is the sexism and misogyny women experience in the workplace. “60% of women in tech reported unwanted sexual advances” (Becker, 2018) because of the male dominated workplace culture. Mistreatment of such makes it suffocating and can be mentally draining for women, driving them away from the field. Eventually, this imbalance creates biased views and products due to not having enough women’s voices heard. Though there have been efforts in creating support for women in STEM/tech, these efforts can only do so much. Existing online mental health resources provide group video chat group sessions that bring up concerns relating to privacy. About 1 in 3 women in tech believe that "they aren't sure that their company has made an effort to address gender equality concerns in the tech industry" (Doyle, 2020). It's clear that many women still feel unsure about the efforts placed into eradicating sexism by their companies, which means that more effort and action must be taken in order to make the working environment an inclusive place that can support every employee’s mental well-being.
