## Problem
The pandemic has exacerbated the unique stressors that fall on women in tech, leading to poor mental health outcomes.

Mental health remains today a leading concern in global well-being. As documented in the Sustainable Development Goals report, "suicide is among the leading causes of mortality among people aged 15 to 29..." (SDG, 2021). Over the course of the pandemic, the percentage of adults with anxiety or depressive disorder has increased from 10% to 40% (Nirmita Panchal, 2021). In addition, the pandemic has been adding onto the burdens of unpaid work for women much more than men (UN, 2021) and women in tech are twice as likely to get laid off compared to men (Daley, 2021). Research surrounding women working in STEM fields shows they are likely to report “higher levels of stress and anxiety and higher incidences of depression” (Lynch, 2016). These factors have been shown to be a determining component for work engagement and intention-to-leave one’s job (Reiley et. al., 2018). The gender disparity in tech sources from many different factors and one main factor that creates a larger gap is the sexism and misogyny women experience in the workplace. According to Becker, “60% of women in tech reported unwanted sexual advances” (2018) because of the male dominated workplace culture. Mistreatment of such makes it suffocating and can be mentally draining for women, driving them away from the field. Eventually, this imbalance creates biased views and products due to not having enough women’s voices heard.

Though there have been efforts in creating support for women in tech, these efforts can only do so much. Even though there are some existing online resources, such as podcasts and books, to educate people about mental health and how to improve it, there is not one that is targeted to help young women in STEM with their mental health concerns which are rooted from work place strugglings. About 1 in 3 women in tech believe that "they aren't sure that their company has made an effort to address gender equality concerns in the tech industry" (Doyle, 2020). It's clear that many women still feel unsure about the efforts placed into eradicating sexism by their companies, which means that more effort and action must be taken in order to make the working environment an inclusive place that can support every employee’s mental well-being.



## Solution
There are plenty of resources proven to improve mental health outcomes in certain individuals. If we take the resources that are most applicable to women in tech, and pair them with stress-relieving activities such as the creation of art (Brenner, 2019), journaling (Smyth et. al., 2018), and sharing with a support group (Suresh et. al., 2021), women who use our product will see improvements in their mental health.

This is the sign-up/log-in page that users first encounter. It will require atleast an 8-key password, along with a unique username with a max of 8 letters. If the user enters a too long or too short username or a username that is already in use, they will receive an error that tells them why they cannot use that username. Similarily, if the user enters a password that does not follow the guidelines, they will receive an error to pick a different password. If the user already has an account and enters in a wrong username and/or password, they will receive an error that tells them which input is wrong. The screen has a navigation bar across the top that contains four interactable buttons on the right side of the bar: Art, Journal, Account, Resources. However, if the user is not logged in and tries to click on any of the navigation bar’s links, they will receive an error that instructs them to sign in first.

This is the Art Page where users can create their own stickers from preselected shapes. The navigation bar Art button should be highlighted to indicate that the user is on the Art Page. The page should have a color palette on the left hand side for users to be able to change the colors of their shapes. In the center of the page, there should be a canvas where users can start forming their sticker art. The canvas should feature a save button, where the users will be able to download their art onto their devices. There should also be a clear button for when users want to erase their content. On the bottom of the page, the preselected shapes will be shown with side arrows to navigate through the list like a carousel. The Shapes button should be highlighted to indicate to users that they are looking at preselected shapes.

In addition to creating their own stickers, users can use the stickers they’ve created to create more stickers. Aside from using preselected shapes, they can add on to their previous creations and make stickers that are more complex. They can access their previous creations by clicking on the option next to “Shapes”. The ‘My Stickers’ button will be highlighted to indicate to users that they are looking at the stickers they created. From there, they can view and select their previous creations and use it as they wish.

This is a more detailed view of what users can do with stickers. They have the ability to freely create art with the preselected stickers and their previously created stickers. By saving this piece, users gain the ability use it as a sticker in future pieces.

This is the Journal page where users can create journal entires. In the navigation bar, the Journal link is highlighted. Above the entry box is a question asking the user how they are feeling today. The entry box below is where users will be able to create the journal entry. Users can then click save and select a sticker which will save the journal entry for that day. This sticker is then used as an icon for this journal entry. If the user has not yet created an account or is not signed in, they will be redirected to the sign-up/log-in page. Additionally, if the entry box is empty and the save button is clicked, the user will be warned that there is nothing to save.

This is the page to View Journal Entries. Here, users can view previously entered journal entries. This is formatted as a calendar with the current day highlighted and the ability for the user to go to previous months. Additionally, a day with a sticker indicates there is a journal entry for that day. The sticker is the same sticker the user chose when saving the journal entry. Interacting with a day with a sticker will direct the user to the entry they made and interacting with a day without a sticker will direct the user to the Journal page where they can create a new entry.

This is the Resources Page where users can access useful mental health resources and inspiring pieces relatable to women in tech. The Resources link in the navigation bar should be highlighted. There will be a Titles/Categories list on the left hand side of the page that will detail the various content sorted by genre. To the right of the list, the content will be displayed along with its title and author. Users can click on different titles in the list and the main content should change accordingly.
