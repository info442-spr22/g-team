## Problem
Being a woman in the tech industry brings with it stressors which have only been worsened by the pandemic.

Mental health remains today as a leading concern in global well-being. As documented in the Sustainable Development Goals report,
"suicide is among the leading causes of mortality among people aged 15 to 29..." (SDG, 2021). Over the course of the pandemic, 
the percentage of adults with anxiety or depressive disorder has increased from 10% to 40% (Nirmita Panchal, 2021). In addition,
the pandemic has been adding onto the burdens of unpaid work for women much more than men (UN, 2021) and women in tech are twice 
as likely to get laid off compared to men (Daley, 2021). Research surrounding women working in STEM fields shows they are likely 
to report “higher levels of stress and anxiety and higher incidences of depression” (Lynch, 2016). These factors have been shown 
to be a determining component for work engagement and intention-to-leave one’s job (Reiley et. al., 2018). The gender disparity 
in tech sources from many different factors and one main factor that creates a larger gap is the sexism and misogyny women experience 
in the workplace. According to Becker, “60% of women in tech reported unwanted sexual advances” (2018) because of the male dominated 
workplace culture. Mistreatment of such makes it suffocating and can be mentally draining for women, driving them away from the field. 
Eventually, this imbalance creates biased views and products due to not having enough women’s voices heard. Though there have been 
efforts in creating support for women in STEM/tech, these efforts can only do so much. Even though there are some existing online 
resources, such as podcasts and books, to educate people about mental health and how to improve it, there is not one that is targeted 
to help young women in STEM with their mental health concerns which are rooted from work place strugglings. About 1 in 3 women in tech 
believe that "they aren't sure that their company has made an effort to address gender equality concerns in the tech industry" (Doyle, 2020). 
It's clear that many women still feel unsure about the efforts placed into eradicating sexism by their companies, which means that more 
effort and action must be taken in order to make the working environment an inclusive place that can support every employee’s mental well-being.
